## Why?

Every IT professional knows that feeling when you need a break but don't want to look idle. Now you can:

- Take that well-deserved coffee break
- Step away for a quick snack
- Have a brief meditation moment
- Discuss important matters with colleagues

All while your terminal displays an impressively realistic installation process that would make any DevOps engineer proud.

## What It Looks Like

The simulator cycles through various realistic installation scenarios:

- **APT Package Installation**: Downloads and installs packages from mirrors with progress bars
- **Source Compilation**: Compiles modules with detailed progress
- **Test Execution**: Runs comprehensive test suites with passing tests
- **Cache Building**: Builds application caches for routes, views, services
- **Asset Optimization**: Minifies JavaScript, CSS, images with size savings

All with authentic colors, progress indicators, and realistic timing!

## Pro Tips

1. Position your screen where others can see it
2. Leave your IDE open in another window for extra authenticity
3. Keep a serious, concentrated expression
4. Occasionally nod thoughtfully when you return
